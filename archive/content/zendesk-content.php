<h2><a href="http://www.zendesk.com/?ptnr=0018000001CLPUR" target="_blank">Zendesk</a></h2>
<p>For many years, 'Contact Us' forms have ruled a majority websites as a general point of contact for users. Start stripping away the impersonal and robotic old practices and engage your target audience.</p>
<p>Zendesk offers a customer service (helpdesk) platform that will fit any company, no matter the size or need. It is designed for companies that want to focus on customer relationships and client bases. It facilitates great one-on-one support and helps those businesses build out self-service options and proactive customer engagement. The end goal is to enable customer relationships that are more meaningful, personal, and productive.</p>
<p>Zendesk offers a wide range of reporting methods that gives you insight into how your helpdesk is running. It provides data about your ticket volume and management, forums usage, and agent performance. It also enables you to compare key ticket metrics within your helpdesk, and further compare it to industry averages.</p>
<p>And the best part, while we fully endorse it, Atomic Acorn employs it as well. We are a well trained, voiced, authorized partner and can set this product up for you.</p>
